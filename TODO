Here are a few things that people have asked for, or I believe need to
be in the NISPerl package.  If you want to implement any of these, let
perl-nis@lists.fulcrum.com.au know to avoid dupication of effort, and
to keep some consistency in the overall design.

- Implement remainder of NIS+ interface
- Implement group handling
- Implement directory handling
- Tie interface for simple access to data
- Credential manipulation
